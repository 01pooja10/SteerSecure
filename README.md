__Driver Safety and Security__

## Data
__Dataset Used__: State Farm Distracted Driver Detection.

You may find the dataset for distracted drivers below at:

## Description
**SteerSecure** is a driver-safety app built using machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow and OpenCV, and scripted and deployed to the web using Streamlit. Our aim with SteerSecure is to make vehicular travel safer. Our two primary web-applications are:

-  Distraction Detection using Computer Vision
-  Drowsiness Detection using Computer Vision
-  Chatbot using a Deep Neural Network and Natural Language Processing


The data is very clear: more than 30% of accidents are caused due to fatigue caused by long, nonstop hours of driving and sleep-deprication. A large majority of accidents are also caused by distracted drivers: texting, speaking to passengers, talking on the phone, etc. Such accidents cause more than 400 deaths everyday in India. Not only is it a tragic loss of life, but it also costs our economy upwards of 1 trillion rupees every year.

Our goal, very simply, is to curb this loss of life and property as best we can. SteerSecure aims to discourage distracted drivers and encourage drowsy drivers to take rest, or pull over before continuing on the journey later.

## Problem Statement
An application called __SteerSecure__ for driver safety using distraction detection, drowsiness detection and a proposed chatbot for informing customers.

## Use cases:
The use cases of our proof of concept web application are aplenty so let's explore them:
-  Can be used as an in-built module in a car to monitor driver activity and hence, safety.
-  Can be used to generate a detailed history of driver's attributes 

## Some features of SteerSecure:
SteerSecure comes packaged with a wide array of exotic features and we'll explain some significant ones:
-  Ensuring driver and passenger safety by warning the driver whenever they get distracted.
-  Playing a loud alarm to alert the driver when they feel dizzy or sleepy.
-  Displaying warning messages even when it detects the driver yawning.
-  Providing valuable and eye-opening information regarding the sheer number of accidents caused due to such avoidable circumstances.
-  Helps in keeping a tab of when the warning messages were displayed or alarm was sounded for an accurate history of the driver's behavior.

## Future Developments to SteerSecure:
1) Integrate with an interface inside your car, similar to a dashboard, for quick access to our services
2) Chatbot automatically sends messages to your loved ones alerting them if it notices regular patterns of drowsiness or Distraction
3) Car goes into self driving mode automatically when the SteerSecure app sends information regarding driver's alertness
